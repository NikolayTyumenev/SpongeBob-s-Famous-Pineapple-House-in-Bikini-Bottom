                        <h3>Pineapple House Architecture</h3>
                        <p>The architectural design of SpongeBob's pineapple house represents a masterpiece of cartoon logic and creative world-building. According to the show's production designers, the pineapple's distinctive diamond-pattern exterior was specifically chosen to create visual interest while maintaining simplicity for animation purposes. The three-story interior layout, as revealed through various episodes, includes a fully equipped kitchen, a library containing hundreds of books, SpongeBob's bedroom with his iconic boat-shaped bed, and Gary's personal space complete with exercise equipment and reading materials.</p>

                        <h3>Gary's Pineapple Corner</h3>
                        <p>Gary the Snail's designated areas within the pineapple house offer insight into the show's thoughtful character development. Throughout the series, we learn that Gary is far more intelligent than he appears, with his own library card, extensive book collection, and even the ability to translate multiple languages. His corner of the house, as shown in episodes like "Gary Takes a Bath" and "Gary's New Toy," includes specialized amenities that reflect his sophisticated personality hidden beneath his simple "meow" communication.</p>

                        <h3>Inside the Pineapple House</h3>
                        <p>The interior of SpongeBob's pineapple house showcases some of the most creative set design in animation history. Based on official production art and episode analysis, the living room features the famous boat-mobile couch that appears in countless episodes, positioned strategically for optimal television viewing and jellyfish observation through the front window. The kitchen, where SpongeBob practices his fry cook skills, contains equipment that mirrors his workplace at the Krusty Krab, allowing him to perfect his craft at home.</p>

                    <h3>📍 Pineapple House Location</h3>
                    <p>The placement of SpongeBob's pineapple house at 124 Conch Street creates one of animation's most memorable neighborhood dynamics. The show's creators deliberately positioned the house between Patrick's rock and Squidward's Easter Island head to maximize comedic potential and character interaction. This triangular arrangement, visible in establishing shots throughout the series, has become so iconic that it's instantly recognizable even in simplified form, appearing on merchandise, video games, and promotional materials worldwide.</p>

                    <h3>🌊 Ocean Views from Pineapple Windows</h3>
                    <p>The circular porthole windows of SpongeBob's pineapple house have framed countless memorable scenes throughout the show's run. These windows, consistently drawn with a distinctive cross-pattern frame, serve both practical and narrative purposes. They allow natural light to illuminate the interior during daytime scenes while providing SpongeBob with views of passing sea life, approaching visitors, and the occasional dramatic event unfolding in Bikini Bottom.</p>

SpongeBob's morning routine, featured in episodes like "Rise and Shine," showcases the house's various rooms and their specific functions. The foghorn alarm clock, the elaborate bathroom where SpongeBob performs his "18-hour" hygiene routine, and the kitchen where he feeds Gary have all become integral parts of the show's visual vocabulary.</p>

                <div class="bubble">Creator chose pineapple as symbol of hospitality and welcome!</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="fact-content">
                <p>The origin story of SpongeBob's pineapple house, as revealed in the episode "Truth or Square," shows the pineapple falling from a boat above and landing perfectly on the sea floor, instantly becoming a fully furnished home. This moment has been referenced and parodied countless times throughout the series, becoming one of the show's defining pieces of mythology. According to the SpongeBob SquarePants Annual 2020, the house has been destroyed completely at least 20 times throughout the series but always regenerates or is rebuilt by the next episode.</p>
                
                <p>Creator Stephen Hillenburg, a marine biologist turned animator, chose a pineapple specifically because of its association with hospitality and welcome in many cultures, reflecting SpongeBob's friendly personality. In interviews, the show's designers have revealed that early concepts included SpongeBob living in various other objects, including a treasure chest and a disco ball, before settling on the now-iconic pineapple. The house's ability to regenerate, first shown in "Home Sweet Pineapple," has become a running gag that exemplifies the show's playful approach to continuity and logic.</p>
                
                <p>What makes this residence particularly fascinating from a design perspective is how it demonstrates the show's commitment to consistency. Despite being destroyed and rebuilt numerous times throughout the series, the house always returns to its exact original configuration. The SpongeBob SquarePants Encyclopedia, published by Nickelodeon, confirms that the house contains exactly 12 rooms, though viewers typically see only five or six regularly. This attention to detail in maintaining continuity has helped make the pineapple house feel like a real, lived-in space that audiences can mentally map and explore alongside the characters.</p>

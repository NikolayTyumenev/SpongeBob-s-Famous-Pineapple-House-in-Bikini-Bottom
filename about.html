    <h2>About DrDoodlebob25</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm DrDoodlebob25, your guide to everything about SpongeBob's pineapple house! My journey with SpongeBob began in 1999 when the show first aired, and I've been fascinated by the pineapple house ever since. The name DrDoodlebob25 combines my love for the chaotic DoodleBob episode with the 25th anniversary milestone of this incredible show.</p>
    
    <p>As DrDoodlebob25, I've spent years documenting every appearance of the pineapple house, from its origin story in "Truth or Square" to its countless destructions and regenerations. This website represents my passion project - a comprehensive resource where fellow fans can explore the architectural wonder that is SpongeBob's pineapple home.</p>
    
    <p>Why the pineapple house? Because it represents everything magical about SpongeBob - it's impossible yet believable, silly yet meaningful, and it's a symbol of hospitality that welcomes everyone to Bikini Bottom. Through this site, DrDoodlebob25 aims to share that same welcoming spirit with SpongeBob fans worldwide.</p>

<!-- SECTION 1: NEWS ARTICLE REVIEW (349 words) -->
<section id="krabby-patty-news" class="news-article-review">
    <h2>Krabby Patty Comes to Life: Wendy's Celebrates 25 Years of SpongeBob</h2>
    
    <p>In October 2024, fast-food history was made when Wendy's brought the legendary Krabby Patty from Bikini Bottom to the real world. According to CNN Business, Wendy's launched its "Krabby Patty Kollab" meal on October 8, 2024, marking a momentous collaboration between the restaurant chain and Paramount to celebrate SpongeBob SquarePants' remarkable 25th anniversary. This limited-time menu featured two special items: the Krabby Patty Kollab burger and the Pineapple Under the Sea Frosty, available across the United States, Canada, and Guam.</p>
    
    <p>The collaboration represents more than just a nostalgic menu item—it's a cultural phenomenon that bridges generations of SpongeBob fans. The Krabby Patty Kollab burger stayed remarkably true to the show's spirit, featuring a quarter-pound beef patty, two slices of American cheese (one more than a regular cheeseburger), fresh lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and most importantly, a "top-secret Krabby Kollab sauce" served on a toasted premium bun. Meanwhile, the Pineapple Under the Sea Frosty combined Wendy's classic vanilla Frosty with a tropical pineapple-mango flavored puree swirl, creating an entirely new flavor experience that paid homage to SpongeBob's iconic pineapple house.</p>
    
    <p>What makes this partnership particularly special is the attention to detail and respect for the source material. As CNN reported, Wendy's emphasized that the collaboration makes perfect sense because it brings together "two of the most iconic squares in pop culture"—referencing both Wendy's famous square burgers and SpongeBob SquarePants himself. The restaurant chain even created an immersive drive-thru experience in Panorama City, Los Angeles, where customers could feel transported to Bikini Bottom while ordering their Krabby Patty.</p>
    
    <p>For SpongeBob enthusiasts and pineapple house fans like us, this collaboration was a dream come true. CNN's coverage highlighted how this partnership tapped into powerful nostalgia marketing, as Wendy's stated: "Fans have eagerly speculated and imagined how this iconic patty might taste, and Wendy's is bringing its Krabby Patty Kollab Burger to land for a limited time." The successful launch demonstrated that even after 25 years, SpongeBob's pineapple house and everything associated with Bikini Bottom continues to capture hearts and appetites worldwide.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Want to learn more about this delicious collaboration?</strong> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/food/wendys-spongebob-squarepants-meal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read the full CNN article here</strong></a> to discover all the mouthwatering details about bringing the Krabby Patty to the surface world!</p>

<!-- SECTION 3: FAVORITE PICNIC SPOT (83 words + Google Maps) -->
<section class="picnic-spot">
    <h2>My Favorite Picnic Spot Near SpongeBob's Pineapple</h2>
    
    <p>My favorite underwater picnic spot is Jellyfish Fields, located just east of SpongeBob's pineapple house in Bikini Bottom. This vibrant meadow bursts with colorful flowers and gentle jellyfish floating through the currents. To get there from 124 Conch Street, simply head past Squidward's Easter Island head, turn right at the coral reef, and follow the glowing jellyfish lights. The journey takes about five minutes of swimming. Jellyfish Fields offers the perfect backdrop for enjoying Krabby Patties while watching SpongeBob's favorite jellyfish dance through the seagrass. It's pure Bikini Bottom magic!</p>
